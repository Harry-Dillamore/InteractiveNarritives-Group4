#### Aims
The zombies in the game will have different types which will determine their attributes and behaviors. The types we are looking to include are:
- Regular: Slow moving, 'traditional' zombies. The majority of the zombies will be this type
- Scouts: Faster zombies with ability to track and follow the player
- Leaders: Similar to regular zombies but more intelligent, with the ability to alert nearby zombies of the player's location.
